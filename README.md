# Basic Python Project

This is my Basic Python Project to answer the simpler data manipulation tasks:

Stages in this project
1. Defining the question
2. Cleaning the data 
3. Analyzing the data
4. Result/Finding

Techniques used
1. Data Cleaning and Transformation
   - Change the columns header
   - Remove the missing value
   - Remove the duplicates
   - Standardizing categorical values
2. Analyze the data
   - Data filtering and counting
3. Summarize the finding

## Project Description

Whenever we're performing analysis, we need to formulate hypotheses that we can then test. Sometimes we accept these hypotheses; other times, we reject them. To make the right decisions, a business must be able to understand whether or not it's making the right assumptions. In this project, you'll compare the music preferences of the cities of Springfield and Shelbyville. You'll look at real Y.Music data to test the hypotheses below and compare user behavior for these two cities.

 ## Hypotheses

1. User activity differs depending on the day of the week and from city to city.
2. On Monday mornings, Springfield and Shelbyville residents listen to different genres. This is also true for Friday evenings.
3. Springfield and Shelbyville listeners have different preferences. In Springfield, they prefer pop, while Shelbyville has more rap fans.

## Description of the data

Description of columns:
- 'userID' — user identifier
- 'Track' — track title
- 'artist' — artist's name
- 'genre'
- 'City' — user's city
- 'time' — the exact time the track was played
- 'Day' — day of the week
